 \\[ \Delta E_{\text{cam02}} = \sqrt{ (\Delta J'/K_L)^2 + (\Delta a')^2  + (\Delta b')^2  } \\]

 where:

\\[ J' = \frac{(1 + 100 c_1)J}{1 + c_1 J} \\]
\\[ M' = \frac{\ln (1 + c_2) M}{c_2} \\]
\\[ a' = M' \cos h \\]
\\[ b' = M' \sin h \\],

and with *J* lightness, *M* colorfulness, and *h* hue angle, correlates, as defined in the CIECAM02 space[^luo].
This color difference formula was derived using two color difference data sets, the first set representing samples with a relatively Large Color Difference (LCD),
the other representing samples with Small Color Differences (SCD).
The \\( K_L \\), \\( c_1 \\), and \\( c_2 \\) coefficients were chosen to fit the experimental data from the two sets:

|             |       LCD   |      SCD   |      UCS  |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| \\( K_l \\) | 0.77        | 1.24       | 1.0       |
| \\( c_1 \\) | 0.007       | 0.007      | 0.007     |
| \\( c_2 \\) | 0.0053      | 0.0363     | 0.0228    |

The coefficients listed in the third column, labelled UCS, were found to fit both data sets best, when combined.
