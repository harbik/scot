Colorado is an open-source Color Science data and algorithms library written in the Rust programming language, and is developed by Gerard Harbers (Harbers Bik LLC).
It targets applications such as color management and quality control for displays, graphic arts, and architectural lighting.
It implements methods and standards as defined by international standard organizations,
such as the **CIE**, the *International Commission on Illumination*,
and implements many other experimental color algorithms and datasets.

Colorado is free and open-source, and is released under dual MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses.

The base for the color algorithms in this library are spectral power distributions of emissive sources such as lights and displays, 
and spectral reflectivity and spectral transmissivity of materials.
Spectral distributions are typically obtained from measurements using spectrometers, or defined by international standards.
Many of these are contained in this library for use in standard calculations, or for use as examples and testing.

## Features:
- Spectral power distributions library for a lamps and illuminants, such as fluorescent and LED lamps.
- Materials spectral reflectivity library.
- Spectral distributions from mathematical models such as Planck blackbody radiators, Gaussian spectra, and mathematical LED models.
- Spectral interpolation and spectral calculation using the Rust `nalgebra` package.
- Calculate tristimulus values from spectral data using a number of standard observers such as CIE1931 2ยบ, CIE1964 10ยบ, CIE 2015 2ยบ and 10ยบ.
- Calculate chromaticity coordinates and appearance correlates based on a number of color models.

## Disclaimer
The data, methods, and algorithms in this library, 
referencing Standard Organizations such as the International Commission on Illumination (CIE), or any other Standards Organizations, 
have not been endorsed, qualified, or approved by these Standard Organizations. 
Please consult their documentation and standards for authoritative methods, recommendations, and data. 
If you find any deviations or errors between the official standards and the implementations in this library, please report them as issues on its GitHub page.
Please be also aware that light and color measurements are difficult and depend on a lot of factors, 
with many of them outside the scope of this library and its applications. 
If you have a professional lighting, display lighting, or color issue, please consult a specialist.
