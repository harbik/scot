/*!
 **Colorado** is an open-source Color Science library, written in the Rust programming language.
It is being developed by Gerard Harbers (Harbers Bik LLC).
Its intended use is color research and development of color management tools for displays, graphic arts,
and architectural lighting.
It implements methods and standards as defined by international standard organizations
(such as the **CIE**, the *International Commission on Illumination*),
and many other, still experimental color algorithms and data.

Colorado is free and open-source, and is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

The library contains a large collection of spectral distribution data, and provides many spectral calculations tools.
It uses `nalgebra`'s linear algebra and matrix library for implementation of the algorithms.

Spectral distributions are typically measured using spectrometers, and the library supports various data formats of spectral distribution files.
Besides using measured data from files, the library also includes many spectral distributions defined by international standards, and a collection of spectral libraries.
Spectral distributions can also be derived from physics laws and mathematical models, also included in the library.

## Features
- Spectral power distributions library for a lamps and illuminants, such as fluorescent and LED lamps.
- Materials spectral reflectivity library.
- Spectral distributions from mathematical models such as Planck blackbody radiators, Gaussian spectra, and mathematical LED models.
- Calculate tristimulus values from spectral data using a number of standard observers such as CIE1931 2ยบ, CIE1964 10ยบ, CIE 2015 2ยบ and 10ยบ.
- Calculate chromaticity coordinates and appearance correlates based on a number of color models.

## Disclaimer
The data, methods, and algorithms in this library, 
referencing Standard Organizations such as the International Commission on Illumination (CIE), or any other Standards Organizations, 
have not been endorsed, qualified, or approved by these Standard Organizations. 
Please consult their documentation and standards for authoritative methods, recommendations, and data. 
If you find any deviations or errors between the official standards and the implementations in this library, please report them as issues on its GitHub page.
Please be also aware that light and color measurements are difficult and depend on a lot of factors, 
with many of them outside the scope of this library and its applications. 
If you have a professional lighting, display lighting, or color issue, please consult a specialist.
