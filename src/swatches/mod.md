# Swatch Libraries: Spectral Reflectivities of Color Sample Collections

Swatches are samples of materials used to check or represent its color.
They often come in a collection in form of a "swatch book" or "color book", but you can also find them as small sample cards in the paint section of your do-it-yourself paint store,
to select a paint color.
These swatches are meant to be a representative sample of the color of the material: when you have applied the paint to your wall, or when you get the final textiles from the supplier, the swatch should match the color you got.

Swatches are also made to categorize colors in a systematic way, such a in the Munsell color system, to form a color space.

These swatches are non-emissive, and need to be illuminated with an illuminant to see their color.
The spectral distribution of an illuminant will influence a swatch' color appearance.

Swatches are represented here by their spectral reflectivity distributions, scaled in such a way that the spectral reflectivity of a perfect white sample has a reflectivity value of 1.0, or 100%, across its spectral domain.

Spectral distributions of color samples, or color swatches, as found in color swatch books and guides. 

A `Swatch` is a trait in this library.


Currently, this library has the following collections:
